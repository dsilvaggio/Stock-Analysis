# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of Project
  An analysis of different stock prices and volume was completed in order to determine how different stocks performed over the years 2017 and 2018.
### Purpose
  Steve is a recent finance graduate who is helping his parents decide which green energy companies they should be buying stock in. They had originally bought stock in DQ, but after finding that this company has not been performing well, data on 11 other green energy companies was perfomred in order to help his parents choose the best company to invest in. Steve was also interested in adding data on how the entire stock market has performed over the years 2017 and 2018, in order to provide his parents with more research.
