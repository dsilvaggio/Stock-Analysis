# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of Project
  An analysis of different stock prices and volume was completed in order to determine how the stocks of different green energy companies performed over the years 2017 and 2018.
### Purpose
  Steve is a recent finance graduate who is helping his parents decide which green energy companies they should be buying stock in. They had originally bought stock in DQ, but after finding that this company has not been performing well, data on 11 other green energy companies was perfomred in order to help his parents choose the best company to invest in. Steve was also interested in adding data on how the entire stock market has performed over the years 2017 and 2018, in order to provide his parents with more research. 
## Results of Stock Performance
  Based on the code that was ran, I was able to see the total daily volume and percent return for each of the 12 stocks included in this data set for the years 2017 and 2018. A table of the 2017 daily volume and percent return can be seen below:

  All but 1 of these stocks in 2017 had a positive yearly return, meaning that all but 1 of these stocks experienced an increase in their price. This means that these 11 stocks would have netted an increase in your investment. 
  However, the year 2018 showed a much different picture. A table of the 2018 daily volume and percent return can be seen below:

  In 2018, only 2 stocks on this list had a positive yearly return, which means that most of the stocks listed experience a decrease in their stock price. We can also see that the total daily volume for these 10 stocks dramatically decreased from 2017 as well. This means that these 10 stocks were traded significantly less in 2018 then they were in 2017.
   There were 2 stocks that maintained a positive yearly return as well as significantly increased their total daily volume between 2017 and 2018. These 2 companies are referred to with the ticker symbol ENPH and RUN. These would be companies that I would suggest Steve's parents look at investing into.
